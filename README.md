<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- text about the real time prediction -->
The Green OpenLab Foundation is a non-profit organization with a mission to promote entrepreneurship among young people in rural areas and territories. Their goal is to connect small, medium, and large-scale farmers with young innovators through an approach of open innovation. One of their primary objectives is to encourage the use of technology among farmers, particularly in the face of climate change. By doing so, they hope to build resilience in rural communities and promote sustainability in agriculture.

<br>

Another key aspect of the Foundation's work is to raise awareness among young people about climate-related issues, environmental concerns, and food security. Through their programs and initiatives, they seek to cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset among young people, particularly in AgriTech, GreenTech, and FoodTech. They also provide funding for prototypes and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for startups, helping them to access the market quickly and efficiently.

Overall, the Green OpenLab Foundation is a vital organization that plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable agriculture and entrepreneurship in rural communities. Through their initiatives, they help to empower young people and provide them with the tools they need to succeed in the world of agriculture and innovation.

<br>

Neural Prophet is a comprehensive Python library designed to simplify time series forecasting using an autoregressive model with exogenous regressors (ARX). Built on top of PyTorch, the library is designed to be fast, scalable, and user-friendly, while offering an exceptional level of flexibility and extendibility. One of the standout features of Neural Prophet is its focus on speed and scalability, allowing users to train models quickly and efficiently, even when dealing with large and complex data sets.

Moreover, Neural Prophet is easy to use, making it an ideal choice for users with different levels of technical expertise. The library is designed to be intuitive, with a clean and simple interface that makes it easy for users to get started with forecasting right away. Furthermore, the library is highly modular, which means it can be customized and extended to meet specific user needs, without requiring extensive coding expertise.

## Dataset

<br>

The dataset used in this project is weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The dataset contains hourly weather data for 2019, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The dataset also includes hourly weather data for 2020, which will be used to test the model's performance.

## Additional Applications

<br>

we have created a django application that allows the user to upload a csv file containing the weather data and then visualize the results of the prediction in the form of graphs.with a logistec regression model we can predict the weather if its going to rain or not.

## Built In Technologie
There are numerous technologies employed in this project's final product, taking into account design, back-end, front-end, and more, but we may concentrate on the most crucial one as the following.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

_The project's concept may seem a little sophisticated, but the steps for getting started are quite simpler. We may summarize them as follows.._

1. Make sure that connection is really istablished
2. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bouslama-hamza/NEURAL_FORECASTING.git
   ```

3. Go To the Real Time Series Folder
   ```
   cd Forecasting-App
   ```

4. Install needed packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
5. Launch the server at 3000 port
   ```
    nodemon app.js
   ``` 

7. The model is trained and in the same time the server is running, you can go to the browser and type the following url
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
